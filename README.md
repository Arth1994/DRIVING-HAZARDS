Project Title:-Driving Hazards

Name of the Scene:-Driving.
Our Scene has the following assets in it: -
•	Terrain Environment
•	Concrete Road
•	Animal Crossing Sign
•	Cougars
•	Car
Brief Description of the scene.
Initially when the user starts the scene, she/he will be sitting inside the car. When the user starts the car, she/he will pass through different tutorials which will provide the user with information on how to accelerate the car, steer the car, brake the car and what the user should do when she/he approaches an animal crossing sign.
So once the user is done with the tutorial, the user can continue driving through the scene and explore the area around.
There are various cougars who some who are walking on the road and some of them are crossing the scene.
If the user happens to hit the cougar or hit a rock on the side of the road the windshield of the car will break with the impact. 

Working of the Project(PS NOTE: Both Hands Should be on the Steering Wheel)

1.	Right Vive Trigger Button: -The Right Vive Trigger Button is used for accelerating the car. If you leave the trigger button the car will start to decelerate.

2.	Left Vive Touchpad: -With the help of the left Vive touchpad you can interact with the car steering and move It accordingly so as to move the car in the desired direction.

3.	Right Vive Touchpad: -With the help of the right Vive touchpad you can interact with the car steering and move It accordingly to move the car in the desired direction.

4.	Left Trigger Button:-If you want to brake the car while it’s in motion you should use the left trigger button.

5.	Right Grip Button: - If you want to reposition the car back to its initial position you should use the right grip button.

Conclusion: -We have successfully met all the requirements as mentioned by the professor in the preliminary prototype document, the final prototype document and also managed to achieve the stretch goal for the project.

Please Note: - We have significantly improved the project from our preliminary and met all the demands mentioned by the professor for the preliminary prototype as well as the final prototype.
